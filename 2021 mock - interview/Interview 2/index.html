<!-- 2. The question Pranshu asked was that the user will not be able to
add more characters after a certain limit has been reached (deleting 
characters is still possible). He asked Saksham to disable the button 
when the text area is empty and enable it when something is typed.
As an extension of this, you can also cover the edge case that the 
button should remain disabled if there are only spaces in the text area.
